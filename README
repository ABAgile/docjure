# Docjure

Docjure makes reading and writing Office documents in Clojure easy.
It was written by Martin Jul using the Apache POI library.

## Usage

; Load a spreadsheet and read the first two columns from the 
; price list sheet:
(->> (load-workbook "spreadsheet.xslx")
     (select-sheet "Price List")
     (select-columns {:A :name, :B :price}))

> [{:name "Foo Widget", 100}, {:name "Bar Widget", 200}, ...]

## Installation

You need to install the Leiningen build tool to build the library.
You can get it here: http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

The library uses the Apache POI library which will be downloaded by
the "lein deps" command.

Then build the library:

lein deps
lein compile
lein test
lein uberjar
lein install
